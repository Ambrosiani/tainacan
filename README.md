### What is Tainacan?

Tainacan is a software solution for building, managing and publishing digital repositories of any kind. It is composed of a WordPress plugin, which is being developed on this repository, and a [companion WordPress theme](https://github.com/tainacan/tainacan-theme) especially designed to produce beautiful digital exhibits.

### Features

**API and interoperability**. Taincan implements an API RESTful that allows other applications to interact with your repository. Display your collection in different formats such as JSON, JSON-LD and OAI-PMH. If your collection uses a custom standard, you can map it to well-known stardards such as DublinCore.
